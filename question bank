SCORING SUMMARY
Maximum Possible Scores:
Each dimension: 100 points (20 questions × 5 points maximum per question)
Total possible: 300 points across all three dimensions
Score Calculation:
After answering all 20 questions, sum up the points for each dimension
Convert to percentage: (Total Points / 100) × 100
Calculate Overall Integrity Index: (Integrity % + Public Trust % + Sustainability %) / 3
Example: If a student scores:
Integrity: 65 points = 65%
Public Trust: 58 points = 58%
Sustainability: 72 points = 72%
Overall Integrity Index: (65 + 58 + 72) / 3 = 65%

Your Strengths:
Realistic problem-solving
Ability to work within constraints
Generally sound ethical foundation
Understanding of practical challenges

**TIER 4: CRITICAL AWARENESS NEEDED (Below 40%)
7. THE SPECTATOR
Score Range:
Integrity: 40-59%
Public Trust: Below 40%
Sustainability: Below 40%
Profile Description: You recognize ethical issues but often choose inaction. You see corruption happening around you, but you tell yourself it's not your problem or that speaking up won't make a difference. You may have decent personal integrity, but your unwillingness to act means you're enabling the very corruption you claim to oppose. Your voice and choices matter more than you think—silence is a choice, and it has consequences.
Your Strengths:
Ethical awareness exists
Recognition of right and wrong
Potential to become active
Growth Areas: Courage to act and think beyond immediate consequences. Corruption thrives because good people stay silent. You need to understand that inaction isn't neutrality—it's choosing the side of whoever has power. Every time you witness wrongdoing and say nothing, you make it easier for corruption to spread.
Critical Recommendations:
Immediate Actions:
Identify one situation where you've been a spectator and take action
Find allies who share your concerns—you don't have to act alone
Document what you witness so you can report it appropriately
Study whistleblower protections and ethical reporting mechanisms
Remember: courage is not the absence of fear but acting despite it
Long-term Development:
Reflect on what's holding you back: Fear? Apathy? Learned helplessness?
Build connections with people who model active integrity
Start with lower-stakes situations to build your courage muscle
Recognize that your comfort zone may be enabling harm to others
Your Potential Impact: You have the awareness to be a Guardian—you just need the courage. The world needs people who move from observation to action. Small acts of courage inspire others and create momentum for change.

8. CORRUPTOR
Score Range:
Integrity: Below 40%
Public Trust: Below 40%
Sustainability: Below 40%
Profile Description: Corruption thrives when good people stay silent or choose convenience over principle. This is your wake-up call. Your current pattern of choices is actively harmful—to yourself, to others, and to the systems you're part of. Whether through active participation in corruption or passive enablement, you're contributing to environments where integrity cannot flourish. But here's the crucial truth: transformation is possible, and it starts with the next choice you make.
Current Reality:
Pattern of compromised choices across all dimensions
Contribution to corrupt systems (actively or passively)
Erosion of personal character and community trust
Short-term thinking that creates long-term harm
Why This Matters:
For Students: Every shortcut now is practice for bigger compromises later. The person who cheats in school becomes the professional who cuts corners. Your character is being formed right now—what kind of person are you becoming?
For Teachers: You hold positions of trust and shape young lives. When you compromise integrity, you don't just hurt yourself—you teach students that principles don't matter. You're either building or destroying the next generation's moral foundation.
For Entrepreneurs: Business built on corruption is built on sand. You might see short-term gains, but you're creating legal risks, destroying trust, and guaranteeing long-term failure. Plus, you're making your industry worse for everyone, including yourself.
The Path Forward:
Step 1: Stop the Harm (Immediate)
Identify your most serious ethical compromise and stop it today
If you've participated in corruption, stop participating
If you're aware of serious wrongdoing, report it to appropriate authorities
Accept that there may be consequences—facing them with integrity is better than continuing down this path
Step 2: Make Things Right (Short-term)
Where possible, correct past wrongs (return stolen items, come clean about fraud, pay back misappropriated funds)
Apologize to those you've harmed
Accept appropriate consequences rather than trying to avoid them
Understand that rebuilding trust takes time
Step 3: Fundamental Rebuilding (Long-term)
Identify your core values and write them down
Find an integrity mentor or counselor
Remove yourself from environments that normalize corruption
Build new relationships with people who model integrity
Practice making ethical choices in small matters to rebuild your character
Seek professional help if needed—this is a serious behavioral pattern
Critical Resources:
For Immediate Support:
Ethics hotlines and reporting mechanisms in your institution
Legal counsel if you're implicated in serious violations
Counseling services to address why you've made these choices
Whistleblower protection resources
For Long-term Growth:
Ethics courses and integrity training programs
Books on character development and ethical leadership
Support groups for people rebuilding their integrity
Regular self-reflection and accountability partnerships
Your Potential: The fact that you took this assessment suggests some part of you wants to do better. That matters. People can change, and many have walked back from serious ethical failures to become forces for good. But change requires:
Honest acknowledgment of the problem
Willingness to face consequences
Commitment to different choices going forward
Patience with a long rebuilding process
Humility to seek help and guidance
